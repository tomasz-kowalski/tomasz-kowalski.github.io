<b>Wisława Szymborska<br>
<br>
A WORD ON STATISTICS</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Out of every hundred people,<br>
<br>
those who always know better:<br>
fifty-two.<br>
<br>
Unsure of every step:<br>
almost all the rest.<br>
<br>
Ready to <font size="3">help,<br>
if it doesn't take long:<br>
forty-nine.<br>
<br>
Always good,<br>
because they cannot be otherwise:<br>
four—well, maybe five.<br>
<br>
Able to admire without envy:<br>
eighteen.<br>
<br>
Led to error<br>
by youth (which passes):<br>
sixty, plus or minus.<br>
<br>
Those not to be messed with:<br>
four-and-forty.<br>
<br>
Living in constant fear<br>
of someone or something:<br>
seventy-seven.<br>
<br>
Capable of happiness:<br>
twenty-some-odd at most.<br>
<br>
Harmless alone,<br>
turning savage in crowds:<br>
more than half, for sure.<br>
<br>
Cruel<br>
when forced by circumstances:<br>
it's better not to know,<br>
not even approximately.<br>
<br>
Wise in hindsight:<br>
not many more<br>
than wise in foresight.<br>
<br>
Getting nothing out of life except things:<br>
thirty<br>
(though I would like to be wrong).<br>
<br>
Balled up in pain<br>
and without a flashlight in the dark:<br>
eighty-three, sooner or later.<br>
<br>
Those who are just:<br>
quite a few, thirty-five.<br>
<br>
But if it takes effort to understand:<br>
three.<br>
<br>
Worthy of empathy:<br>
ninety-nine.<br>
<br>
Mortal:<br>
one hundred out of one hundred—<br>
a figure that has never varied yet.<br>
