<font size="3">A homeless page is a young courtier who has nowhere to live. I used to be one. Except that I wasn't a courtier... 

<p>
I was born on another planet. The main country on that planet was called the Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics and led the workers of the world - united, no less -
to the paradise of communism. My neck of the woods on that planet was 
called People's Republic of Poland. It was a dreary planet. Look <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/tomasz-kowalski/power-of-taste">here</a> for one powerful description - by Zbigniew Herbert - of how dreary it was. <br>
</p>
<p>But there were universities - relics of better times. I went to one of them: the  
<a href="http://www.en.uj.edu.pl/en">Jagiellonian University</a> in Krakow.<font size="3"> I graduated from the Jagiellonian, worked at the Department of Logic there (a good part of my heart still is in the seminar room where equivalences were proved "towards the stove" and "towards the window"), got my PhD. 
Meanwhile, on 4 June 1989 a little miracle happened: semi-free elections were 
held in Poland (exactly on the day of Tiananmen massacre: <b>about a year before the Berlin wall fell</b>). Afterwards, my planet began drifting towards your planet.</font></p>
</font><font size="3">In 1998 I moved to <a href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/index-e.html">Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a>,
 where I worked for 5 years. In 2003, I moved to Australia, first to ANU
 in Canberra, then - after a stint in Italy and Portugal - to Melbourne. I maintain a strong connection with the 
<a href="http://people.unica.it/alophis/">ALOPHIS</a> group from the University of Cagliari.

<font size="3"> Two words that describe what I do: logic and algebra. <br>
</font></div>

</font></div>
<div><font size="3">Three words that describe what I like: mountains, music and literature. Not necessarily in that order.<br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3"><br>
</font></div>
<div><font size="3">Three acronyms that describe what I teach: MAT4MT, MAT3DSA, MAT2ALC. If you do not know what they mean, you are like myself. Acronyms should be banned!<br>

There will be links here for Discrete Structures and Algorithms, and&nbsp; Algebra and Linear Codes, eventually. <br>

I am not a statistician, but could<font size="3"> not help putting in a <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/tomasz-kowalski/a-word-on-statistics">a word on statistics</a></font></font> <font size="3">by Wislawa Szymborska.</font><br>
<font size="3">
<p><font size="3">One more Polish connection - the last 
one, I promise. Some time ago I came across two books (in Polish), which
 seriously made the the following claim <i>it would have been better if 
just before the outbreak of World War II Poland took a strategic move 
very different from what happened in real history.</i> I was not amused.
 What I did not like&nbsp; was the assumption that making a different 
strategic move was not only possible, but indeed rational in the 
circumstances. Well, let's see... moves in strategic games call for a 
game-theoretic analysis, so 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/tomasz-kowalski/strategic-games-on-xemya">here is one</a> dressed in a sci-fi costume to avoid offending sensibilities.<br>

In case you wondered, the picture on the left (properly interpreted) is of a BCK algebra. It shows that BCK algebras do not have CEP (acronyms should be banned!)</font><br>
