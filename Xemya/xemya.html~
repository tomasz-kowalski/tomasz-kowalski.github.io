<p> <font size="3">Here is a brief version of the story. If you wish a longer version, read <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/tomasz-kowalski/strategic-games-on-xemya/intro.pdf?attredirects=0">this</a>. <br>

</font>
<p><font size="3"><br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Consider planet Xemya. On Xemya, just like on Earth,
there are countries, and believe it or not, it is not unheard of for 
Xemyans to wage war. There are two neighbouring
countries on Xemya, called Apollonia and Tysq. Tysq is a
  major power, Apollonia is not.
  Other Xemyan powers include Albania (by a strange coincidence
there is a country called Albania on Xemya), Coqauvin, Ruritania, Sipango,
and Ammer-Ku. </font></p>
<font size="3">

</font>
<p><font size="3"> At some point in troubled Xemya's history, Tysq goes nasty and demands that
Apollonia hand over to them a spaceport, over which it - Apollonia that is - has
some sort of dubious half-authority, by way of exercising a mandate of an international
peace-keeping organisation (whose peace-keeping successes are comparable with
those of UN on Earth). Tysq's diplomats left
Apollonians in no doubt that should they fail to meet their demand, bad things
of the military sort are sure to happen to Apollonia. </font></p>
<font size="3">

</font>
<p><font size="3"> This worries Apollonian strategists quite a lot. They are well aware
of the fact that Apollonia is no match for Tysq, which is quickly growing
stronger and more aggresive. Not 
a year has passed since Tysq gave a similar ultimatum to Tscheslavia.
Under diplomatic pressure, mainly from Albania and Coqauvin,
Tscheslavia duly complied, yet it was invaded and
occupied by Tysq. </font></p>
<font size="3">
  
</font>
<p><font size="3"> Apollonia hastily arranges some alliances, important ones with Albania and
Coqauvin. Indeed, Albania and Coqauvin propose an alliance themselves,
stating their unvawering support for Apollonia and encouraging her to stand firm. 
This gives hope to Apollonian populace, but the strategists are not all that
optimistic. It is their job to consider worst-case scenarios, and such scenarios
  are looking grim. To begin with, a great war seems inevitable.
  There is just too much tension around:
  
  </font></p>
<font size="3">
</font>
<ul>
    <li><font size="3"> Ruritania claims she has a mission to liberate every oppressed Xemyan.
      To accomplish this worthy goal, she has to conquer the whole planet.
    </font></li>
<li><font size="3"> Tysq and Sipango are sworn enemies of Ruritania. They have their
      own way of making xemyankind evolve into a better species.
      By force, if neccessary.
    </font></li>
<li><font size="3"> Albania, Coqauvin and Ammer-Ku are happy to let everyone else
    be, as long as they engage in free trade. On their terms. 
    </font></li>
<li><font size="3"> Albania and Coqauvin have recently defeated Tysq. She
    resents it, and is getting ready for revenge.
    </font></li>
<li><font size="3"> Resource-hungry Sipango feels suffocated by a blockade imposed by
      Ammer-Ku and Albania, and needs to do something about it.
    </font></li>
<li><font size="3"> Finally, both Tysq and Ruritania seem to be convinced, each for
      different reasons, that Xemya without the nuisance of Apollonia would
      be a better Xemya.   
  </font></li></ul>
<font size="3">

</font>
<p><font size="3"> Against this pleasant background, Apollonia's strategists set out to
  work. The question is: accept or reject?

</font></p>
<font size="3">
</font>
<p><font size="3"> Acceptance means surrender. But at this cost Apollonia could perhaps avoid an immediate
  and disastrous war. <i>Perhaps</i>, because Tysq's real intentions may not be as
  minimalistic as the ultimatum suggests. 

</font></p>
<font size="3">
</font>
<p><font size="3"> Rejection 
  means war. But an alliance of Apollonia, Albania and Coqauvin
  theoretically has enough power to defeat Tysq. <i>Theoretically</i>, because
  military alliances on Xemya have an unpleasant tendency to be unreliable
  and unstable.
</font></p>
<font size="3">
  

</font>
<p><font size="3"> What to do? Where conventional wisdom fails, unconventional wisdom
  is available, in the form of an oracle. To the oracle the strategists
    go.


<form name="estimate" action="" onsubmit="estim(); return false">
There is the usual fuss at the beginning. Oracles have to live, too, so a little donation is always welcome, but then the oracle accepts the enquiry and falls into trance. 
She emerges with two questions:
<p>

<table class="form">
  <tr>
    <td><i><b>How likely do you think it is that Tysq will attack you no matter what you do?</b></i></td>              
              <td><select id="pAttack">
              <option value="0" selected="selected">- Answer me! -</option>              
              <option value="5">Very unlikely</option>              
              <option value="4">Unlikely</option>              
              <option value="3">Fifty-fifty</option>              
              <option value="2">Likely</option>              
              <option value="1">Very likely</option>              
</select>
  </td>
    </tr>              
<tr>
<td><i><b>How do you estimate the price of surrender, in present
      circumstances? </b></i></td>               
              <td><select id="hLoss">
              <option value="0" selected="selected">- Answer me! -</option>

The oracle, as you might have guessed, applies some simple game theory. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ltumathstats.com/tomasz-kowalski/strategic-games-on-xemya/oracle.pdf?attredirects=0">Here</a> is more on that.</font></p>
