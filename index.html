A homeless page is a young courtier who has nowhere to live. I used to be one. Except that I wasn't a courtier... </p>

<p>
I was born on another planet. The main country on that planet was called the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and led the workers of the world - united,
no less - to the paradise of communism. My neck of the woods on that planet was 
called People's Republic of Poland. It was a dreary planet. Look
<a href="power-of-taste.html">
here</a> for a powerful description - by Zbigniew Herbert - of how dreary it was.
</p>

<p>
But there were universities - not entirely unaffected or immune, but generally
retaining the flavour of better times. I went to one of them: the  
<a href="http://www.en.uj.edu.pl/en">Jagiellonian University</a> in Krakow.
I graduated from the Jagiellonian, worked at the Department of Logic there (a
good part of my heart still is in the seminar room where equivalences were
proved "towards the stove" and "towards the window"), got my PhD.  
Meanwhile, on 4 June 1989 a little miracle happened: semi-free elections were 
held in Poland. Two things about this day are worth mentioning. One is that it
wasn't a miracle, of course, but a cerefully crafted move which left the
former communists in possession of most of the country's
wealth. But it <b>seemed</b> a miracle then. The other is the date:
exactly the day of Tiananmen massacre. 

<p>
Afterwards, my planet began drifting towards your planet.
</p>

<p>
In 1998 I moved to <a href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/index-e.html">Japan Advanced
 Institute of Science and Technology</a>,  where I worked for 5 years. In 2003,
 I moved to Australia, first to ANU  in Canberra, then - after a stint in Italy
 and Portugal - to Melbourne. I maintain a strong connection with the  
<a href="http://people.unica.it/alophis/">ALOPHIS</a> group from the University
of Cagliari.

<p>
Two words that describe what I do: logic and algebra.
</p>

<p>
Three words that describe what I like: mountains, music and literature. Not
necessarily in that order.
</p> 

<p>
Three acronyms that describe what I teach: MAT4MT, MAT3DSA, MAT2ALC. If you do
not know what they mean, you are like myself. Acronyms should be banned!

Here is
my <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tomasz_Kowalski3">Research Gate
  page</a>. And here is the page

I am not a statistician, but could not help putting in a
<a href="a-word-on-statistics.html">a word on statistics</a>
by Wislawa Szymborska.
</p>


  
<p>
One more Polish connection - the last 
one, I promise. Some time ago I came across two books (in Polish), which
 seriously made the the following claim <i>it would have been better if 
just before the outbreak of World War II Poland took a strategic move 
very different from what happened in real history.</i> I was not amused.
 What I did not like&nbsp; was the assumption that making a different 
strategic move was not only possible, but indeed rational in the 
circumstances. Well, let's see... moves in strategic games call for a 
game-theoretic analysis, so 
<a href="Xemya/xemya.html">here is one</a>
dressed in a sci-fi costume to avoid offending sensibilities.<br> 
</p>

<p>
In case you wondered, the picture on the left (properly interpreted) is of a BCK
algebra. It shows that BCK algebras do not have CEP (acronyms should be banned!)
