THE POWER OF TASTE</b><br>
<br>
<i>For Professor Izydora Dambska</i><br>
<br>
<br>
It didn't require great character at all <br>
our refusal disagreement and resistance <br>
we had a shred of necessary courage <br>
but fundamentally it was a matter of taste <br>
<div style="padding-left:100px">Yes taste</div>
in which there are fibers of soul the cartilage of conscience <br>
<p>
Who knows if we had been better and more attractively tempted <br>
sent rose-skinned women thin as a wafer <br>
or fantastic creatures from the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch <br>
but what kind of hell was there at this time <br>
a wet pit the murderers' alley the barrack <br>
called a palace of justice <br>
a home-brewed Mephisto in a Lenin jacket <br>
sent Aurora's grandchildren out into the field <br>
boys with potato faces <br>
very ugly girls with red hands <br>
 <p>
Verily their rhetoric was made of cheap sacking <br>
(Marcus Tullius kept turning in his grave) <br>
chains of tautologies a couple of concepts like flails<br>
the dialectics of slaughterers no distinctions in reasoning <br>
syntax deprived of the beauty of the subjunctive <br>
 <p>
So aesthetics can be helpful in life <br>
one should not neglect the study of beauty <br>

<p>
Before we declare our consent we must carefully examine <br>
the shape of the architecture the rhythm of the drums and pipes <br>
official colours the despicable ritual of funerals <br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Our eyes and ears refused obedience <br>
the princes of our senses proudly chose exile</p> 


It did not require great character at all <br>
we had a shred of necessary courage <br>
but fundamentally it was a matter of taste<br>
<div style="padding-left:100px">Yes taste</div>
that commands us to get out to make a wry face draw out a sneer <br>
even if for this the precious capital of the body the head<br>
<div style="padding-left:200px">must fall <br>
